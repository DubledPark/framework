	 * \par [Inherited] 
	 * <p>Maps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of 
	 * a key value and a mapped value, following a specific order. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> In a map, the key values are generally used to sort and uniquely identify the elements, 
	 * while the mapped values store the content associated to this key. The types of key and 
	 * mapped value may differ, and are grouped together in member type value_type, which is 
	 * a pair type combining both: </p>
	 *
	 * \li typedef pair<const Key, T> value_type;
	 *
	 * <p> Internally, the elements in a map are always sorted by its key following a specific 
	 * strict weak ordering criterion indicated by its internal comparison object (of type Compare). </p>
	 *
	 * <p> map containers are generally slower than unordered_map containers to access individual 
	 * elements by their key, but they allow the direct iteration on subsets based on their order. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> Maps are typically implemented as binary search trees. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> The mapped values in a map can be accessed directly by their corresponding key 
	 * using the bracket operator ((operator[]). </p>
	 * 
	 * <p> Maps are typically implemented as binary search trees. </p>

	 * 
	 * @tparam _Kty 
	 * <p> Type of the keys. Each element in a map is uniquely identified by its key value. </p>
	 * <p> Aliased as member type map::key_type. </p>
	 *
	 * @tparam _Ty 
	 * <p> Type of the mapped value. Each element in a map stores some data as its mapped value. </p>
	 * <p> Aliased as member type map::mapped_type. </p>
	 *
	 * @tparam _Pr 
	 * <p> A binary predicate that takes two element keys as arguments and returns a bool. 
	 * The expression comp(a,b), where comp is an object of this type and a and b are key values, 
	 * shall return true if a is considered to go before b in the strict weak ordering the 
	 * function defines. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> The map object uses this expression to determine both the order the elements follow 
	 * in the container and whether two element keys are equivalent (by comparing them reflexively: 
	 * they are equivalent if !comp(a,b) && !comp(b,a)). No two elements in a map container 
	 * can have equivalent keys. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> This can be a function pointer or a function object. This defaults to std::less<T>, 
	 * which returns the same as applying the less-than operator (a<b). </p>
	 *
	 * <p> Aliased as member type map::key_compare. </p>
	 *
	 * @tparam _Alloc 
	 * <p> Type of the allocator object used to define the storage allocation model. By default, 
	 * the allocator class template is used, which defines the simplest memory allocation model 
	 * and is value-independent. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> Aliased as member type map::allocator_type. </p>
