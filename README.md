##### With Samchon Framework, you can ~
  1. Build a cloud system
    - A new cloud system which has
      - A medium to large scale
      - Performance issue
      - Memory management issue
    - From an *ordinary* C++ solution 
  2. Integrate systems with standard ~
    - Message protocol
    - Data expression method
  3. Construct complicate network system easily 
    - within framework of Object Oriented Design 
      - by considering a (physical network) system as a object (class)
    - Like
      - Interaction with external network systems.
      - (Tree-structured) distributed processing system.
      - (Tree-structured) parallel processing system.
  4. Uiltize libraries independent on operating systems
    - enable to corss-compile.


##### Samchon Framework has developd by
  Samchon Framework is a framework for realizing cloud and distributed processing system with C++.

  C++, literally, is the main language of Samchon Framework for building cloud and distributed processing system. Other languages categorized in JavaScript like TypeScript and Flex(JS) are used to build web-client connecting to the C++ cloud server.
    - TypeScript, it even supports building a slave system belongs to a distributed processing system.
  
  Supported Database script files and those designs are for archiving history log from cloud services or distributed processing systems which are built from C++ with Samchon Framework.

##### Samchon Framework provides
  Samchon Framework provides thosand pages documents to be helpul for users' comprehension. The user not only means programmers who are using Samchon Framework, but also some people who want to participate in Samchon Framework, the open source project.
  
  Documetns are divided into Architecture Designs & API Documents. They each present macroscopic and microscopic point of view. Architecture Designs are suitable for architects and (network) system engineers and API Documents are suitable for programmers.
