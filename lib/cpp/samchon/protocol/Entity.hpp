	 * @brief An entity, a standard data class

	 * @details
	 * <p> Entity is a class for standardization of expression method using on network I/O by XML. If 
	 * Invoke is a standard message protocol of Samchon Framework which must be kept, Entity is a 
	 * recommended semi-protocol of message for expressing a data class. Following the semi-protocol
	 * Entity is not imposed but encouraged. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> As we could get advantages from standardization of message for network I/O with Invoke, 
	 * we can get additional advantage from standardizing expression method of data class with Entity. 
	 * We do not need to know a part of network communication. Thus, with the Entity, we can only 
	 * concentrate on entity's own logics and relationships between another entities. Entity does not
	 * need to how network communications are being done. </p>

	 * 
	 * @note
	 * <p> I say repeatedly. Expression method of Entity is recommended, but not imposed. It's a semi
	 * protocol for network I/O but not a essential protocol must be kept. The expression method of
	 * Entity, using on network I/O, is expressed by XML string. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> If your own network system has a critical performance issue on communication data class, 
	 * it would be better to using binary communication (with ByteArray or boost::serialization).
	 * Don't worry about the problem! Invoke also provides methods for binary data (ByteArray). </p>
